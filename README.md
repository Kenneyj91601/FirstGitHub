# FirstGitHub
---
### This is my first GitHub project and I honestly don't really know what I'm doing and I am kinda just winging it.

I guess I'll just start off with the cliche **_Hello World_** text because that is apparently a thing in like... every new project when it comes to any coding. I kind of like that everything starts with ***_Hello World_***, it makes it seem like I'm creating something that's coming to life, like Frankenstein's monster, which probably would not be a good thing. But anyways this is fun. I've been having a hard time just understanding how to write markdown files and put them into GitHub... just to realize that I can write them directly in the ReadMe.md file, so I'm a little hurt finding that information out, grade-wise, feelings-wise, and time-wise to be exact.

I am going to stop rambling and get into what I am _actually_ supposed to be doing in this ReadMe.md branch.

## About Me: Kenneth Jackson :)

Hellooooo ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a very self-absored take on humanity in which I only talk about my life and things that make me happy while I type with weird _underlines_ and **asterisks** everywhere on the page that you cannot see because **_al_mighty** and **_all_seeing** in this realm and you are but a mortal who can only read what I want you to read!

### Here are a couple things about me:
- I love art and drawing pretty much anything.
- I'm addicted to watching anything on [YouTube](www.youtube.com).
